–––––––––––  BUSINESS INSIGHTS REPORT  –––––––––––

The following report summarizes key business insights obtained from the final curated tables of the Gold Layer. These insights were generated by applying SQL queries to answer the business questions required by the project.

All the results are based on the cleaned and transformed datasets stored in the Gold Layer, which are ready for analysis. The data was prepared considering the elimination of duplicates, correction of inconsistent values, and applying necessary mappings for fields such as countries, cities, operators, and plan types.

1. Average Revenue per User (ARPU) by Plan Type

    The average ARPU was calculated by grouping users according to their plan_type, using data from the gold_revenue_summary table. ARPU is obtained by dividing the total revenue per customer by the number of customers, and helps to understand how much revenue a user generates on average based on their contracted plan.

    | plan_type         | avg_arpu |
    | ----------------- | -------- |
    | Prepago           | 269.01   |
    | Control           | 280.21   |
    | Pospago           | 269.74   |

    It can be seen that Control plan customers have a slightly higher ARPU compared to Prepago and Pospago, which might be related to specific plan conditions or higher service consumption.

2. Revenue Distribution by Geographic Location

    This analysis shows the total revenue generated by customers, grouped by their country of residence. The information is based on cleaned country 
    data after applying standardization and city-country mapping corrections.

    The following table summarizes the revenue distribution across countries:

    | Country         | Total Revenue |
    | --------------- | ------------- |
    | Colombia        | 751,943.64    |
    | Perú            | 201,173.79    |
    | Argentina       | 168,206.41    |
    | México          | 138,442.49    |
    | Chile           | 89,261.03     |

    This information allows the company to identify which markets generate the most revenue and where potential growth strategies could be focused.

3. Customer segments generating the highest revenue

    To identify which customer segments contribute the most to revenue, the data was segmented by country, age group, and operator using the gold_revenue_summary and gold_customer_summary tables.

    | country   | total_revenue |
    | --------- | ------------- |
    | Colombia  | 5535954.72    |
    | Perú      | 1479294.54    |
    | Argentina | 1198532.35    |
    | México    | 990548.24     |
    | Chile     | 642720.39     |

    By Country:
    Customers from Colombia generate the highest revenue, followed by Perú and Argentina.

    | age_group | total_revenue |
    | --------- | ------------- |
    | Over 50   | 4522011.85    |
    | 31-50     | 3158553.91    |
    | 18-30     | 1962056.37    |

    By Age Group:
    The Over 50 segment contributes the most to revenue, followed by the 31-50 and 18-30 groups. This suggests that older customers tend to generate more revenue, likely due to longer service contracts or more expensive plans.

    | operator | total_revenue |
    | -------- | ------------- |
    | Claro    | 2537074.11    |
    | Wom      | 2521230.63    |
    | Tigo     | 2479279.48    |
    | Movistar | 2309466.02    |

    The operators Claro, Wom, and Tigo lead in revenue generation, with Movistar slightly behind.

4. Customer distribution by location

    To understand how customers are geographically distributed, the gold_customer_distribution_location table was used. This table summarizes the number of customers per country based on cleaned location data.

    | country         | customer_count |
    | --------------- | -------------- |
    | Colombia        | 2546           |
    | Perú            | 691            |
    | Argentina       | 601            |
    | México          | 496            |
    | Chile           | 326            |

    The results show that:
        Colombia has the largest customer base by far, representing a significant portion of the total users.
        Perú, Argentina, and México follow, with similar customer counts.
        Chile has the smallest customer base among the analyzed countries.

5. Age distribution of customers by plan type

    The average age of customers was calculated by grouping them according to their plan type using the gold_customer_summary table. Only customers with valid age data were considered.

    | plan_type         | avg_age |
    | ----------------- | ------- |
    | Prepago           | 49.4    |
    | Control           | 49.3    |
    | Pospago           | 48.8    |

    Older customers appear evenly distributed across different plan types, with a slight concentration in the Prepago segment.

6. Age distribution of customers by country and operator

    The average age of customers was calculated by grouping them by country and operator using the gold_customer_summary table. Only customers with valid age data were considered.

    | country         | operator         | avg_age |
    | --------------- | ---------------- | ------- |
    | México          | Tigo             | 51.3    |
    | Perú            | Movistar         | 50.7    |

    | Argentina       | Movistar         | 48.2    |
    | Colombia        | Wom              | 49.5    |
    | Colombia        | Movistar         | 48.6    |
